# Music-Player-Impressions
An program to simulate a Music Player using Data Structures and Algorithms

The basic idea is to use Tries to store the names of all the songs.
Playists are implemented as different tries which stores songs for respective playlist.

Different genres of songs are implemented using an adjacency list which stores the trie of songs
for respective genre,

The tries allow fast searching and adding of songs to the player.

All the data is stored on txt files locally.
